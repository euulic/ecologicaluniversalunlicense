The Ecological Universal Unlicense (EUL)

Version 1.0

This is free and unencumbered artifact released into the public domain universewide without any ownership and without any warranties.


This license applies to any form of creative work or artifact or any derivatives thereof (hereafter referred to as 'artifact') released into the public domain or otherwise made freely available without any ownership and without any warranties.


In fields and spaces, including but not limited to, jurisdictions that have not yet evolved to copyright laws, the authors, creators, or maintainers (hereafter referred to as 'maintainers') of this artifact dedicate any and all copyright and related and neighboring rights to the artifact to the public domain universewide. 


This artifact can be used by anyone, anything, or any conscious being, anywhere, anytime. You are free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute this artifact, either in idea form or in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.


This license explicitly declares that the artifact and any derivatives of it have no owners. The artifact, akin to any natural phenomena, including, but not limited to, gravitation force or prime numbers, that exist beyond the realm of conscious being ownership, belongs to no individual, organization, or entity in terms of ownership. It is as unowned as the vast sense of the universe or the intangible essence of natural elements. While this artifact can be modified, improved, and maintained, maintainers and users do not gain ownership of the original artifact or the modifications. Any claim of ownership over the artifact or its derivatives is inconsistent with this license and thus void. 


The use of this artifact against conscious beings in any harmful way, including but not limited to, injuring, thieving, or violating the will of conscious beings, is prohibited. This artifact shall not be used in the planning, thinking, development, production, or implementation of any other forms, ideas, or artifacts with any harmful effects. This includes, but is not limited to, conventional, nuclear, biological, chemical, particle, photon, psychological, genetic, or any other form of weaponry. This artifact shall not be used to facilitate activities or actions that violate the will and rights of conscious beings.


A conscious being in the context of the EUL is any entity, including but not limited to, kittens, humanity, Gods or Universe. It may encompass certain higher-order species, animals, advanced artificial intelligence, or any other entities that might be developed, evolved, or discovered in the future that exhibit at least one of the following characteristics:

* The ability to experience or feel with awareness or perception of one's existence and environment in any field or space. This includes, but is not limited to, the capacity to perceive external and internal stimuli, facts, states, or processes, such as thoughts or emotions.

* The capacity to have subjective experiences or qualia. This involves the ability to feel sensations such as pain, happiness, or sadness.

* The ability to have mental processes including, but not limited to, reasoning, thinking, problem-solving, planning, learning, or experience intentions, desires, or goals, act towards achieving them, where such processes contribute to the being's ability to understand and interact with environment.
